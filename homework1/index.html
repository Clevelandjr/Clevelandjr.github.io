                    <p class="main-text"></p> I graduated in 2013 from Shaw University in Raleigh, NC. Iny my time time at Shaw University, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting. My Minor was Business Administration. Shortly after college I moved to Newport News, Virginia and pursued a career at TMX Finance. At TMX Finance I became a General Manager. When I became a general manager and when i left the company, I was the youngest GM in my district. I left the company after 6 years and moved to Charlotte North Carolina to pursue a career as a full stack web developer. I have a friend thats been a web developer for over 10 years. He was the one who told me i would be great doing what he does. One of the reasons I want to become a full stack web developer is because of the constant learning. I love that there will always be new opportunities and challenges with this career. In a few years I see myself advancing as a senior web developer for a company.
                    <p class="main-text"> Im originally from Brooklyn New York. My father was in the army so we constantly moved around. In my spare time I love to work out and spend time with my family and friends. My favorite hobby is basketball.</p>
